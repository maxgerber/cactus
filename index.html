                <p>We recognise that the struggle to continue in an age of global uncertainty can be <strong>all-consuming.</strong></p>
                <p>We take our name from the family of plants which have adapted through millenia to be able to withstand <strong>extreme draught</strong> by conserving large reserves of water.</p>

                    <li>To those hit hardest by cuts to mental health services. <strong>It's called illness because it can be terminal.</strong></li>
                    <li>To fighters for justice in a society upholding <strong>racial hierachy</strong> and then camoflauging its efforts.</li>
