                <p>We recognise that the struggle to keep on in times of economic instability can be <strong>all-consuming.</strong></p>
                <p>We take our name from the miraculous plant which is able to withstand <strong>unimaginable temperatures</strong> because of its ability to retain large amounts of water.</p>

                    <li>To economic migrants and refugees, documented and documented, scapegoated by a system which blames them for inherent flaws of neoliberal capitalism</li>
                    <li>To those hit hardest by cuts to mental health services. It's called illness because it can be terminal.</li>
                    <li>To those fighting for justice in a system that upholds racial hierachy and then camoflauges its existence.</li>
